1. This is my ZMK config for using a (Nijuni)[https://github.com/krikun98/nijuni] (Jorne variant and can be treated similarly) with the (Prospector)[https://github.com/carrefinho/prospector-zmk-module] dongle and a Nice_Nanov2 wirelessly.  If you have a similar configuration with either the Nijuni or the Jorne you may find this useful. Thank you to the ZMK discord for all the help. I have also altered the keymap to my specific specifications.
